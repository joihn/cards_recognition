All models are already trained.
Intermediate files of the testing set are stored to numers/ cards/ redressed_cards/ and suits/ with name game_8_....

In order to launch the algorithm on a test set, copy the 13 .jpg-files to the folder 'test_game' and launch the [main.ipbn](./main.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.
